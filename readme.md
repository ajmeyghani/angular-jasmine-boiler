# Angular Jasmine Boiler

Boilerplate for writing tests for Angular with Jasmine.

## Getting Started

> Make sure you have Node installed

- First, install bower with `npm i bower -g`
- Then, inside the root of the project run `bower install` to install the dependencies.

Now that you have all the dependencies, we can server the project with a server. You can use `http-server .` to server the project. If you don't have `http-server` installed, you can install it with `npm i http-server -g`

Once the server has started, you can then navigate to `run-tests.html` to see the tests.
